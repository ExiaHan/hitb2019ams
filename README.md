#### by HITB2019AMS Badge Team

The conference badge consists of 4 levels. First step is of course turning it on! 

To activate the badge, press any of the buttons. 4 red and 4 green LEDs will start blinking. Each button is mapped to one level. Find the buttons and find your way out.

If you can discover the secret code, enter it into the badge and you will turn the badge into a password cracking badge! This level contains 2 different secret passwords. The light will be your guide.

Tips: Each level comes with different lighting effects, show us your hardware reversing skills and let there be light!
